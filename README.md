# mango
A programming language also written in C.

## reason of creation
A little earlier this year I created Adamite, and I uploaded it to github a few months ago. I thought that I would use some of my spare summer time to create a new language that is similar, but fixes most if not all of the issues with adamite. Of course, all of the problems and issues that I had with adamite would be hard to fix without writing an entirely new language or replacing all of the old adamite code.

## naming scheme
As a disclaimer, I nor anyone I know owns the name "mango" as a copyrighted name or trademark. I don't mean to steal the name or use it without permission, I simply thought of it when thinking of a new project to work on awhile back.

The name has no real meaning, and like adamite, there is no logo or anything to promote the name. Whether it specifically relates to anything that the language has to offer or not, I like the name and I plan to use it so long as it is not copyrighted.

## going further
I am planning on making a new commit every time at least two "sections" are finished. For example, I am working on a brand-new object storage and variable name system as well as an error system, which will probably all come within 3rd commit. I will also make sure to change the README.md file accordingly.
